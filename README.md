## CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization

This repository contains my coursework and final projects for CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization at Southern New Hampshire University.
The course focused on using C++ and OpenGL to create, texture, and illuminate 3D environments—and concluded with a physics-based 2D animation.

## Final Project: 2D Collision Game

For my final assignment, I developed an interactive collision-based 2D animation built entirely in Visual Studio using OpenGL.
The scene features:

A player-controlled paddle using arrow-key input

Multiple bricks with unique colors, hit points, and state changes

A bouncing ball that reacts to collisions with walls, the paddle, and other objects

Physics behavior, including reflection, friction, and speed variation

A circle-merge mechanic when multiple balls collide

Smooth animation timing and modular, readable C++ code

## 3D Scene Project (Milestone Series)

In earlier milestones, I created a fully textured 3D scene that demonstrates:

Object creation and hierarchical transformations using GLM

Material and Phong lighting (ambient, diffuse, and specular)

Camera controls for interactive exploration

Use of textures and shaders for realism

## Technologies Used

C++17

OpenGL / GLFW

GLM – OpenGL Mathematics library

stb_image – texture loading

Visual Studio 2022

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience in:

Applying 2D and 3D transformations and lighting models

Managing vertex/fragment shaders and rendering pipelines

Implementing interactive, physics-based animation

Writing clear, modular, and reusable OpenGL components
