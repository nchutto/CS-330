# CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization

This repository contains my work for **CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization** at Southern New Hampshire University.  
The course focuses on using OpenGL and C++ to design, implement, and render interactive 3D scenes.

## 🧩 Project Overview
For my final project, I developed a detailed 3D scene that demonstrates:
- Object creation and transformation using **GLM**  
- Texture mapping and material properties  
- Implementation of **Phong lighting** (ambient, diffuse, and specular)  
- Interactive camera controls for viewing the scene from multiple angles  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- C++  
- OpenGL  
- GLM (OpenGL Mathematics Library)  
- stb_image for texture loading  
- Visual Studio 2022  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained experience in:
- Applying 3D transformations and lighting models  
- Managing shaders and rendering pipelines  
- Building reusable, object-oriented components for graphics applications  

## 🗂️ Repository Contents
- `/src` – Source code files for the 3D scene  
- `/shaders` – Vertex and fragment shaders  
- `/textures` – Images used for surface materials  
- `README.md` – Project summary and documentation

### Instructor Access
This repository is part of my SNHU Computer Science portfolio.  
My instructor has been added as a **collaborator** to review the project and related materials.
